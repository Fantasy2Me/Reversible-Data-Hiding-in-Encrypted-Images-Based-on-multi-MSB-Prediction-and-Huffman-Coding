## Abstract
With the development of cloud storage and privacy protection, reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDHEI) has attracted increasing attention as a technology that can: embed additional data in the image encryption domain, ensure that the embedded data can be extracted error-free, and the original image can be restored losslessly. In this paper, a high-capacity RDHEI algorithm based on multi-MSB (most significant bit) prediction and Huffman coding is proposed. At first, multi-MSB of each pixel was predicted adaptively and marked by Huffman coding in the original image. Then, the image was encrypted by a stream cipher method. At last, the vacated space can be used to embed additional data by multi-MSB substitution. Experimental results show that our method achieved higher embedding capacity while comparing with the state-of-the-art methods.
